# Hivemind

Hivemind is a _Behavior Tree_ framework that includes a visual editor for Unity 3D.

## Creating a Behavior Tree

In the _Project_ view, simply go to `Create > Behavior Tree` to create an empty Behavior Tree asset. The visual editor can be found in `Window > Behavior Tree Editor`, or simply clicking the `Show Behavior Tree editor` button in the _Inspector_ while a Behavior Tree asset is selected in the project view.
